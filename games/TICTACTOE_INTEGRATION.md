# TicTacToe Game Integration

## Overview
Successfully integrated TicTacToe game into the Accelerate.ai Games Hub with full AI opponent support, difficulty levels, and persistent high scores.

## Files Modified/Created

### Created Files:
1. **games/TicTacToeGame.tsx** - Complete TicTacToe game component
2. **database/migrations/add_high_scores_table.sql** - Generic high scores table migration

### Modified Files:
1. **pages/Games.tsx** - Integrated TicTacToe into the Games Hub

## Implementation Details

### Game Features:
- **Three Difficulty Levels:**
  - **Easy**: Random AI moves
  - **Medium**: Strategic AI (win/block logic)
  - **Hard**: Unbeatable AI using Minimax algorithm

- **Score Tracking:**
  - Wins, losses, and draws
  - Current win streak
  - Persistent high scores (longest win streak) via Supabase

- **UI/UX:**
  - Tailwind CSS styling matching the app's design system
  - Dark mode support
  - Responsive design
  - Smooth animations and transitions
  - Real-time game state updates

### Technical Integration:
- Uses `AuthContext` for user authentication
- Supabase integration for persistent high scores
- Row-level security policies for data protection
- Proper error handling and loading states

## Database Setup

### Step 1: Run the Migration
Execute the migration script in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Located at: database/migrations/add_high_scores_table.sql
```

This creates:
- `high_scores` table with columns: id, user_id, game, score, created_at, updated_at
- Indexes for performance optimization
- Row-level security policies
- Auto-update trigger for `updated_at` column

### Step 2: Verify Table Creation
In Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor, confirm the `high_scores` table exists with:
- Proper columns and types
- Unique constraint on (user_id, game)
- RLS policies enabled

## Testing Instructions

### Basic Gameplay:
1. Navigate to Games Hub (Games tab in sidebar)
2. Find "Tic-Tac-Toe vs AI" in the Puzzle category
3. Click "Play Now"
4. Test each difficulty level:
   - Easy: Should make random moves
   - Medium: Should block wins and try to win
   - Hard: Should be unbeatable

### Score Persistence (Authenticated Users):
1. Sign in to the app
2. Play and win several games in a row
3. Verify current streak increments
4. Verify high score updates when streak surpasses previous record
5. Refresh the page and confirm high score persists
6. Check Supabase `high_scores` table for the record

### UI/UX Testing:
1. Test dark mode toggle (game should adapt styling)
2. Verify animations work smoothly
3. Test "New Game" button
4. Test "Reset Stats" button
5. Verify "Back to Games" button returns to hub
6. Test difficulty selector during an active game (should reset board)

### Error Handling:
1. Test without authentication (should work but not save high scores)
2. Verify proper error messages in console if Supabase fails
3. Confirm game continues to function even if high score fetch fails

## Game Rules

### How to Win:
- Get three of your marks (X) in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
- First to complete a line wins
- If all 9 squares are filled without a winner, it's a draw

### Scoring:
- Win: +1 to wins, increment streak
- Loss: +1 to losses, reset streak to 0
- Draw: +1 to draws, reset streak to 0
- **High Score** = Longest win streak ever achieved

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Multiplayer mode (two human players)
- Timer per move
- Move history/undo feature
- Sound effects
- Alternative board sizes (4x4, 5x5)
- Tournament mode with brackets
- Leaderboard showing top streaks across all users

## Troubleshooting

### Game doesn't load:
- Check console for errors
- Verify `games/TicTacToeGame.tsx` exists
- Confirm `AuthContext` is properly set up

### High scores not saving:
- Verify user is authenticated
- Check Supabase connection
- Run the migration script if `high_scores` table doesn't exist
- Check RLS policies in Supabase Dashboard
- Verify `auth.users` table exists and user has valid ID

### TypeScript errors:
- Run `npm run typecheck` to identify issues
- Ensure all imports are correct
- Verify Supabase types are up to date

✅ High scores persist across sessions for authenticated users
✅ Game integrates seamlessly into Games Hub
✅ UI matches app's design system
